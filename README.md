Introduction
Requirements
To complete this application you’ll need to know Programming Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python. 
You are advised to consult the learning resources shared with you, other cool resources you find online and your learning community to level up on these concepts.

Problem Description
When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only. In this exercise you will be required to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenya’s facilities called The Dojo.

Constraints
The Dojo has rooms, which can be offices or living spaces. An office can accommodate a maximum of 6 people. A living space can accommodate a maximum of 4 people.

A person to be allocated could be a fellow or staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Fellows have a choice to choose a living space or not.

This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.

Expectations
By the end of Task 3 you should have created the following classes and implemented the required functionality within them - Person, Fellow, Staff, Dojo, Room, Office, LivingSpace

Ensure that you are properly structuring your class files and using easily navigable folder structures.
It’s highly recommended that you have UML Class Diagrams for your system. Keep the diagrams in a /designs folder.

Practise Test Driven Development. What this means is that you will be writing unit tests before you create functionality. 

You are free to add on extra functionality beyond what’s specified in the specifications. You are encouraged to do this to exceed expectations.






Task 0 - Version 0 of the System
For this task you are required to create a command line interface using docopt that has the following commands:

create_room <room_type> <room_name>... - Creates rooms in the Dojo. Using this command, the user should be able to create as many rooms as possible by specifying multiple room names after the create_room command.

# Sample input with one office
>>> create_room office Orange

# Sample output with one office
An office called Orange has been successfully created!

# Sample input with multiple offices
>>> create_room office Blue Black Brown

# Sample output with multiple offices
An office called Blue has been successfully created!
An office called Black has been successfully created!
An office called Brown has been successfully created!

add_person <person_name> <FELLOW|STAFF> [wants_accommodation] - Adds a person to the system and allocates the person to a random room. wants_accommodation here is an optional argument which can be either Y or N. The default value if it is not provided is N.

# Sample input for adding Staff
>>> add_person Neil Armstrong Staff

# Sample output for adding Staff
Staff Neil Armstrong has been successfully added.
Neil has been allocated the office Blue

# Sample input for adding Fellow with accommodation option
>>> add_person Nelly Armweek Fellow Y

# Sample output for adding Fellow with accommodation option
Fellow Nelly Armweek has been successfully added.
Nelly has been allocated the office Blue
Nelly has been allocated the livingspace Python



Start with Unittests
Create unittests for:
 The models you have created for Task 0 that ensure the functionality created in the classes are working.
The two functionalities for create_room and add_person. Sample tests for create_room are provided below for your guidance.

import unittest
from my_file import MyClass

class TestCreateRoom(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_create_room_successfully(self):
        my_class_instance = MyClass()
        initial_room_count = len(my_class_instance.all_rooms)
        blue_office = my_class_instance.create_room(“Blue”, “office”)
        self.assertTrue(blue_office)
        new_room_count = len(my_class_instance.all_rooms)
        self.assertEqual(new_room_count - initial_room_count, 1)
        





Task 1 - Version 1 of the System
For this task you are required to write the unittests for the following additional functionality:

print_room <room_name> - Prints  the names of all the people in room_name on the screen.

print_allocations [-o=filename]  - Prints a list of allocations onto the screen. Specifying the optional -o option here outputs the registered allocations to a txt file. See Appendix 2A for format.

print_unallocated [-o=filename] - Prints a list of unallocated people to the screen. Specifying the -o option here outputs the information to the txt file provided.

After your Learning Facilitator has reviewed your tests you can then proceed to implement the 3 functionalities.













Task 2 - Version 2 of the System
For this task you are required to write the unittests for the following additional functionality:

reallocate_person <person_identifier> <new_room_name> - Reallocate the person with person_identifier to new_room_name.

load_people - Adds people to rooms from a txt file. See Appendix 1A for text input format.


Appendix 1A - Sample Input Format

OLUWAFEMI SULE FELLOW Y
DOMINIC WALTERS STAFF
SIMON PATTERSON FELLOW Y
MARI LAWRENCE FELLOW Y
LEIGH RILEY STAFF
TANA LOPEZ FELLOW Y
KELLY McGUIRE STAFF

Appendix 2A - Sample Output Format

ROOM NAME
-------------------------------------
MEMBER 1, MEMBER 2, MEMBER 3

ROOM NAME
-------------------------------------
MEMBER 1, MEMBER 2

After your Learning Facilitator has reviewed your tests you can then proceed to implement the 2 functionalities.
Task 3 - Version 3 of the System
For this task you are required to write the unittests for the following additional functionality:

save_state [--db=sqlite_database] - Persists all the data stored in the app to a SQLite database. Specifying the --db parameter explicitly stores the data in the sqlite_database specified. 
load_state <sqlite_database> - Loads data from a database into the application.

After your Learning Facilitator has reviewed your tests you can then proceed to implement the 2 functionalities.
